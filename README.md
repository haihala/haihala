# Hello there

I'm Eero Häihälä (he/him), a programmer trying to enter the games industry. Ever since I was 14 or so, I've wanted to make games. 
My motivations have shifted over time, right now I'd just want to work with people who care about what they make.

My favourite project to work on is [Whoops! All grapplers](https://github.com/haihala/whoops-all-grapplers), a 2.5D Fighting game project I've been cooking up since 2021.
It's built with [Bevy](https://bevyengine.org/), which has lead me to making a handful of contributions to the ecosystem.

Feel free to copy [my dotfiles](https://github.com/haihala/config). You can also ask for help with anything in there. 
I mostly use it for my neovim configs, but there are various smaller things that are daily parts of my workflow.
[
My blog / portfolio / resume / homepage](https://github.com/haihala/haihala.github.io) can also be freely copied. 
I'm especially proud of how easy it is to operate, with automatic builds and hosting.
